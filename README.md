Hey! Thanks in advance for your time and consideration. Don't forget to check out the projects I've created toward the bottom of the document. I'll keep updating that section as I move through my coding course and into my new career as a full-stack developer.

If you have any questions or just want to chat, shoot me an email at condericson@gmail.com. I'd love to hear from you!
